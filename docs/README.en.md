> This front-end option is optional. If you don't integrate Vue, you can directly skip the front-end (the background management system based on Vue, which is an abnormal attendance project I used to play, has not completely replaced the background management of this project at present, mainly because the background of this project is too ugly! I don't know what I thought when I was a freshman at that time 🤡)

> 1. The SQL file has been provided and only needs to be executed` myblog. sql`

> 4. If the console prints the access path, it is OK



**Front end startup steps * * (optional)

```bash
#打开windows命令行窗口，进入项目目录
cd 路径/topicUI

npm install --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org

#启动项目
npm run dev
```

Open the browser and enter: http://localhost:8080 (the default account / password has two 'admin/1')
